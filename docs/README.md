**Model of the channel activity of a WLAN network**

This model, although very simplistic generates patterns of channel occupancy
similar to what a real WLAN would generate while its underlying traffic pattern
would remain static.
For example if a VoIP application, or big file download would be running,
its traffic pattern would be relatively constant and accurately modelled
by this model.
On the other hand, arrival and departure of applications / sessions / users
are not modelled.

Run the model with `--help` for more information on the model parameters.

You can find a description of the model and its parameters in
[Description.pdf](./Description.pdf)
